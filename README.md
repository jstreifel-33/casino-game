# Casino Game

Site to act as casino game with a variety of table games. Meant to be an exercise in game logic and object manipulation.

This started out as an experiment to see if I could create a deck of cards. The next step was to try to make a game, and maybe even an entire site centered around casino games.

## Current Site Plans

* Home page with a greeting and links around site
* Chip clerk 'counter'
* Blackjack
* Bacarat

## Future Stretch Goals

* Multiplayer card games
  * Poker (Texas holdem, Pai Gow, 5 card)
  * What else is there?
* Craps Table
